        <div class="info">
            <h2>GET</h2>
            <h3>Url For API<lable >/Algorithm/{cin}</lable></h3>
            <p>This calls the Algorithms methods to produce a roadmap. This also uses the classes/taken 
                methods to retrive a list to accurately display a correct roadmap with any classes taken not showing up.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Url For API<lable >/Algorithm/{cin}/{semester}/{year}/{classCode}</lable></h3>
            <p>The frontend uses this when the user edits the roadmap by inserting a class into the roadmap. This endpoint sends the class to the 
                algorithm and makes any changes to make that course into the semester and year they user wanted.
                same as previous endpoint- it uses the classes/taken method to see the previous classes taken.
                Returns a roadmap with previous classes taken not showing and the class they edited into the roadmap into the place they wanted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Url For API<lable >/Algorithm/consume/{cin}</lable></h3>
            <p>This is used for testing purposes to see if the endpoint can properly consume and produce a JSON object.
                We could not get it working even with the syntax being corrent in the API and in the frontend.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>POST</h2>
            <h3>Url For API<lable >/Algorithm/{cin}/classinfo</lable></h3>
            <p>This endpoint is incomplete. This was suppose to consume an incoming JSON object and parse to the appropriate object.
                In this case it was a roadmap object. The object was going to be used to bulk save the roadmap into the database. 
                This was to reduce time instead of making opening and closing connections for each course.</p>
